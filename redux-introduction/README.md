### What is Redux?
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It provides a centralized store to manage the state of your application. Redux follows a unidirectional data flow pattern, where actions trigger state changes via reducers. It promotes predictable and maintainable code by separating state logic from UI components.

>[!NOTE]
> Because Redux is primarily used with React, this tutorial also serves as a React review and tutorial. This Tutorial would have been better taken directly after a React introduction tutorial but was started midway through a MERN full stack tutorial.
