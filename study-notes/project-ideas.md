# Project Ideas 

### Project 1: [Build a Full Stack React Application via AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/)
This will show CI/CD _(Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment or Delivery)_ workflow with a serverless backend.  
ToAnh said this is accomplishable within a few hours and to write a blog aftwards.

### *Ideas*
- TaskBin - a Kanban task flow board
- Personal blog site

### Project 2: [Create a Continuous Delivery Pipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/create-continuous-delivery-pipeline/?ref=gsrchandson)
Highlights version control system and how to do best practices on how to update source code.

### Project 3: [Build a Flutter mobile app using AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-flutter-mobile-app-part-one/)
Builds upon what I already know with Flutter.

### Project 4: [ML | Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-credit-card-fraud-detection/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3Af88aeSb87zDEcjdzfr8OdbbLw_9HRYBq7d14FJi1D7umJQs3NNpl13s_aem_tanba6MbZdSUvEZVf-9--Q)
Impressive ML, Important to state this is not a project I came up with but I can talk about how Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time. 
Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones. Data availability as the data is mostly private.
Misclassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported. Adaptive techniques used against the model by the scammers.


## AWS
### Why AWS?
1. Scales Quickly for global expansion.
2. Resilient and durable for securityy and fail-overs to prepare for things like the [CrowdStrike Blue Screen of Death](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/microsoft-outage-cause-explained-what-is-crowdstrike-and-why-users-are-getting-windows-blue-screen-of-death/articleshow/111858827.cms?from=mdr).
3. Able to spin-up or develop quickly to move for marketing trends and deploy fast.

### AWS Cliff Notes
- Use the free tier for 12 months and *DO NOT* delete the resources.
- Put a budget alert to alert if it goes over $10 or $20
- SAP (simple apps) shouldn't cost very much.
- Keep these projects on resume / blogs with screenshots as proof of work, delete after securing a job.
- Diagram the technologies used.
